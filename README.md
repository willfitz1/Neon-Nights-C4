# RGB-Connect-4

# Welcome to RGB Connect 4. I will advise, you may need sunglasses for the flash of the screen. The Game is simple. Its Connect 4. Everyone loves Connect 4. But this was comes with a twist. First off, the color selector. The game usually goes red / yellow, but in this version, you can pick from 5 colors. And at the end of the game, whoever wins, the background will flash your color to let your opponent know whos the best. The scoreboard will track your wins, and you'll be able to reset it at anytime.
